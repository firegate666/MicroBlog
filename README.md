# Example PHP Framework

## use case "Micro Blog"

This is my educational approach on creating a PHP mini framework on my own.
This all started as concept PHP blog application and continued to be my playground for PHP.

Over the last 2 years I used to spend more or less time on adding and improving features and refactoring a lot of code.

Eventually I want to have a framework that fully supports dependency injection and lazy loading factories from top to bottom.

Still a lot to do until then, but lets see how far I can go.

If you like, please take a look and leave me lots of comments, criticism and advices that help me improving this and myself.

If you want to get this thing running, I have support for Sqlite3 and PDO.

* Just clone the repository
* run composer to solve the dependencies
* set up a base.ini from the sample
* read the sample database structure and data in the database
* point your webroot to the htdocs folder or use bin/server.sh {PORT}

That's it.
